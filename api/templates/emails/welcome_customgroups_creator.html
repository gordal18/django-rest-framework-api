<p>Thanks for signing up and joining UCROO!</p>

<p>Having a Service Page on UCROO means:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Students can join the <?= $name ?> any time, all year-round </li>
    <li>Membership renewal each year is quick and easy</li>
    <li>Your administration and reporting requirements are taken care of</li>
    <li>Your position just became a whole lot easier!</li>
</ul>

<p>Being the Service Page creator allows you to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Edit the <?= $name ?> Service Page</li>
</ul>
