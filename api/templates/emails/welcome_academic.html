<p>Hi {{ first_name }},</p>

<p>Congratulations on creating your UCROO account - your class just became a lot more social!</p>

<p><b>Set up your class</b> on UCROO by adding your teaching periods, consultation times and coursework topics as well as inviting your colleagues and students.</p>

<p><b>Improve learning outcomes and teaching performance</b> by tapping into detailed class analytics from your ‘Admin’ menu as students collaborate throughout the Semester.</p>

<p><b>Save administration time</b> by encouraging students to post coursework queries on UCROO instead of individually emailing repetitive questions.</p>

<p>To link students to UCROO, post this link (http://ucroo.com.au) as an announcement in your Learning Management System so students can access your class discussion seamlessly.</p>

<p>To make sure your UCROO experience runs smoothly, we have created a dedicated support section for academic instructors which can be accessed from your ‘Account’ menu on UCROO or by visiting: <a href="http://support.ucroo.com.au/academics">http://support.ucroo.com.au/academics</a></p>

<p>If you'd rather speak to someone directly, we're here to help and love to chat! You can contact our Support Team via telephone during business hours on (03) 9533 6665 or any time on email via <a href="mailto:support@ucroo.com">support@ucroo.com</a>.</p>

<p>Happy teaching</p>
