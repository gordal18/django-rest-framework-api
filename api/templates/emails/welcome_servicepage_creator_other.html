<p>Apart from being the one-stop-shop for all things <?=$short_name?> related, you can also:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Share timetables with peers so you know who you've got class with and when they're free</li>
	<li>Easily join class groups to collaborate on coursework with classmates in your unit</li>
	<li>Create and join study groups to work on assignments, exams and areas of academic interest  </li>
	<li>Share, laugh and create with peers from across the university, as well as your school and year level</li>
	<li>Chat with relevant peers, classmates, academics and services staff when they're online</li>
</ul> 

<p>We look forward to seeing you on UCROO!</p>
