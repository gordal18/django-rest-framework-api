<p>Hi {{ first_name }},</p>

<p>Congratulations on creating your UCROO account!</p>

<p>As Student Services are such an important part of a student’s support network, we’ve created Service Pages to help <b>improve awareness and access</b> to your Service, whilst saving you time.</p>

<p>You can improve awareness and access to your Service by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating a Service Page for your Student Service</li>
  <li>Posting information, resources and events on your Service Page throughout the Semester</li>
  <li>Answering student queries posted on your Service Page</li>
  <li>Adding any drop-in times for your Service – these are highlighted to students on days they occur</li>
</ul>



<p>To make sure your UCROO experience runs smoothly, we have created a dedicated support section for Student Services staff which can be accessed from your ‘Account’ menu on UCROO or by visiting: <a href="http://support.ucroo.com.au/studentservices">http://support.ucroo.com.au/studentservices</a></p>

<p>If you'd rather speak to someone directly, we're here to help and love to chat! You can contact our Support Team via telephone during business hours on (03) 9533 6665 or any time on email via <a href="mailto:support@ucroo.com">support@ucroo.com</a>.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
