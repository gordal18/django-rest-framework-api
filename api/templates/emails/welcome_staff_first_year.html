<p>Hi {{ first_name }},</p>

<p>Congratulations on creating your UCROO account!</p>

<p>As you would know, supporting students throughout their transition to university life is critical to their success.</p>

<p>To help you support commencing students throughout that period, UCROO automatically connects first year students in the First Year group.</p>

<p>You can get the most out of UCROO in your role by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Encouraging commencing students to sign up to UCROO before Semester starts</li>
  <li>Promote first-year events and activities in the First Year group</li>
  <li>Encouraging students to introduce themselves to other first years (course, interests, fun facts, etc.)</li>
  <li>Highlight important first year announcements and reminders</li>
  <li>Target posts to specific schools or campuses using Advanced Post Options</li>
</ul>

<p>To make sure your UCROO experience runs smoothly, we have created a dedicated support section for staff like you, which can be accessed from your ‘Account’ menu on UCROO or by visiting: <a href="http://support.ucroo.com.au/firstyear">http://support.ucroo.com.au/firstyear</a></p>

<p>If you would rather speak to someone directly, we're here to help and love to chat! You can contact our Support Team via telephone during business hours on (03) 9533 6665 or any time on email via <a href="mailto:support@ucroo.com">support@ucroo.com</a>.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
