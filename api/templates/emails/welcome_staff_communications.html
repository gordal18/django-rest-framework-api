<p>Hi {{ first_name }},</p>

<p>Congratulations on creating your UCROO account!</p>

<p>Utilise the following features to better communicate with students at the university:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>University Feed</b> automatically connects all students at the university in one group – post university-wide information, events and announcements here!</li>
  <li>The <b>First Year Feed</b> automatically connects all students commencing university in one group – this is the place to post enrolment, orientation and transition communications!</li>
  <li>The <b>Final Year Feed</b> automatically connects all students in their final year of university in one group – post careers and post-graduate communications here!</li>
  <li>Use <b>Advanced Post Options</b> when posting in any of these feeds to target specific school or campuses at the university</li>
</ul>
