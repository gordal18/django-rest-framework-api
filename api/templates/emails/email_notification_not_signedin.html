<p>Hi <?php echo $name;?>,</p>
<p>Given itâ€™s been a while since you signed in to your account, we would like to suggest some ways you could be using UCROO to your advantage.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Connect with other students and staff - these people will become your colleagues, employees, friends, advisors and references</li>
    <li>Keep asking questions - staff and students are there to help you learn and to make your life easier</li>
    <li>Use your On Campus bar to schedule your day - it will show when connections are free or in class, any events happening and when your academics are available for consultation</li>
</ol>
<p>We hope that helps!</p>
