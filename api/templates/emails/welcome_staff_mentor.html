<p>Hi {{ first_name }},</p>

<p>Congratulations on creating your UCROO account!</p>

<p>As mentors are such an important part of a student’s support network, we’ve created Mentor Groups to <b>improve awareness and access</b> to mentors, while helping students find a mentor that best suits them.</p>

<p>As a Mentor Program Coordinator, you can achieve this using UCROO by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Encouraging mentors to create a Mentor Group on UCROO</li>
  <li>Encouraging students to find a mentor on UCROO</li>
  <li>Ensuring mentors post helpful resources, information and links in their Mentor Group</li>
  <li>Emboldening students to ask questions in Mentor Groups</li>
  <li>Encouraging mentors to share their timetables with mentees on UCROO</li>
</ul>


<p>To make sure your UCROO experience runs smoothly, we have created a dedicated support section for Mentors which they can be access from their ‘Account’ menu on UCROO or by visiting: <a href="http://support.ucroo.com.au/mentors">http://support.ucroo.com.au/mentors</a></p>

<p>If they would rather speak to someone directly, we're here to help and love to chat! Mentors can contact our Support Team via telephone during business hours on (03) 9533 6665 or any time on email via <a href="mailto:support@ucroo.com">support@ucroo.com</a>.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
