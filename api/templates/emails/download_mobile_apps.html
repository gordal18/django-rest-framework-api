<p>Did you know that UCROO Apps are available for your iPhone or Android phone?</p>
<p>Having UCROO on your mobile puts your entire university community in your pocket and makes it easy to ask questions or access information when you are on the go.</p>
<p>Here are some of the benefits of having the mobile app:</p>
<p>Ask questions as they arise in your lecture or on the way home</p>
<p>Ask other students for help if you are lost on campus</p>
<p>Check your on campus bar as you walk out of class to see whether your connections and/or teachers are free to catch up</p>
