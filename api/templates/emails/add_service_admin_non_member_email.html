<p>Hi <?= $user ?>,</p>

<p>You've been added as a staff member to the <?= $module->getName() ?> Page on UCROO!</p>

<p>UCROO is <?= $module->getUni()->getName() ?>'s private online network, which helps students better connect with their peers and staff at the university.</p>


<p>To better connect students with Student Services, UCROO allows services like us to create a Services Page.</p>

<p>Having a UCROO Page creates greater awareness of the <?= $module->getName() ?> and makes our service more accessible to students.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing you on UCROO.</p>

<p>Kind regards,</p>
