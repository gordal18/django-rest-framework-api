<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p> We're excited to announce we'll be using UCROO (<a href="http://www.ucroo.com">www.ucroo.com</a>) to conduct all class-related discussion this Semester.</p>

<p>UCROO is a private network that connects students with each other as well as university staff. For class discussion, UCROO is designed to help you learn more, while getting you answers fast. The platform supports linking of videos, embedding of images, and attaching of files, as well as a number of other useful teaching tools for me like endorsing of answers and assessment reminders.</p>

<p>Sign up, add this unit during setup and start asking questions on UCROO now (rather than by email) to benefit from the collective knowledge of your classmates and academic instructors.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing you all on UCROO this Semester!</p>

<p>Welcome to class-discussion on UCROO!</p>

<p>UCROO is designed to make learning social and get you answers fast - so if you're struggling with anything, just ask the class! You can also post links, files and polls if you feel like enriching the academic conversation. To help get us started, introduce yourself by telling us something unique about you and what youâ€™re looking forward to learning in this subject!</p>
